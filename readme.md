This tiny Blender addon helps with parenting objects.


1. You can now __Link Parents__ in the "_Link/Transfer Data_" menu (Ctrl+L or Viewport > Object > Link/Transfer Data). It allow you to copy the active object's parent and it's transformation matrix. It supports object, bone and vertex parenting.

2. This addon also finally exposes the obscure __Matrix Parent Inverse__ under the "_Relations_" property panel. This property is now editable through comprehensive transformation properties.
